# Password Generator Starter Code

## Link to the deployed application

## To-do lists
- When the button to generate a password is clicked, a series of prompts for password criteria should be presented.
- When prompted for password criteria, I select which criteria to include in the password.
- When prompted for the length of the password, I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters.
- When asked for character types to include in the password, I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters.
- When I answer each prompt, then my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected.
- When all prompts are answered, then a password is generated that matches the selected criteria.
- When the password is generated, the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page.
